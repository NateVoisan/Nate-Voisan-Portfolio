              My educational journey is a long and arduous one that has gone
              down multiple paths throughout. I went to California State
              University of Long Beach for Fashion Design & Merchandising where
              I received a degree in August of 2019. I learned how to design
              clothing and scale it to specific manufacturing needs as well as
              how to run a clothing company and how to sell product in the most
              efficient manner. During my time at college and thereafter I
              followed a personal passion of mine which was music. I took it
              upon myself to learn how to make music from absolute scratch. I
              had zero previous experience with any musical instruments or
              anything of the sort. Now I am a professional music producer who
              is fully capable of mixing, mastering, and engineering any kind of
              sound.

              As I was searching for my first fashion industry career job in the
              months following my graduation I was met with a pandemic. Where
              there was once a thriving market with too many positions to be
              filled, there was now absolutely nothing. The fashion industry,
              which was largely already on its knees, was completely gutted.
              Many companies were on the verge of bankruptcy and this event made
              sure that would happen. The companies that were still alive were
              rapidly culling their staff to cut costs as well as slashing
              remaining salaries which were already drastically low. This was a
              wake up call to me that the industry I strived to work in had its
              fate sealed.

              My instincts kicked in and told me to adapt. So I took it upon
              myself once again to learn a brand new skill from scratch. This
              time it would be coding. I started out with free online coding
              websites where I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
              I knew I needed more than just free coding websites so I found
              Thinkful: a highly respectable 5 month coding boot-camp for
              engineering immersion. As a student at Thinkful my skills in
              programming have soared and I am absolutely thrilled to be apart
              of this new pathway along my journey.
